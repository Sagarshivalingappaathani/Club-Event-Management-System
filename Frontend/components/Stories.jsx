                    IE has played a very key role in my academic and co-curricular growth. Always getting challenged with new problems and having the liberty to experiment and fall is something for which I'll be forever grateful to IE. It always felt like a home away from home as the seniors were so warm and welcoming. To current and new members, wish you luck to go onwards and upwards!

                    IE NITK has a sense of community, where the members come together, connect, talk, enjoy, share, support each other at all stages while focusing on the members' growth & development. IE gave the freedom and platform which I would have not had anywhere else.
